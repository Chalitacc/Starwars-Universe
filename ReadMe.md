# Starwars Universe

A dynamic and responsive JavaScript application that fetches and displays from the star wars API (SWAPI). Users can explore information about characthers , planets, films and vehicles from the Star Wars universe.

## 🚀 Porject overview

This project demonstrates of asynchronous JavaScript, particularly the fetch API with async/await, to retrieve data from an external API and render it dynamically in the DOM. All interactions occur on a single HTML page without full page reload.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🔄 Dynamic category selection (people, planets, vehicles, films)
- 🌐 Fetches real-time data from the SWAPI API
- 🖼️ Custom images for each entity
- 💡 Respnsive design for different screen sizes

## 🧑‍💻 Tecknologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Fetch API
- SQAPI - [https://swapi.dev](https://swapi.dev)

## 🖼️ Data and images

Since SWAPI does not provide images, all images were manually added under image file. they are amtched to their respective entity by name formatting

## 🧠 Learning objective

To master asynchronous tasks and understaning modular JavaScript development.

## ⚠️ Known issues

SWAPI is occasionally down or may have invalid SSL certificate. In such cases, the data fetch will fail and trigger an error message in the console.

## ✅ Future improvements

- add sorting and filtering capabilities
- animate transition between categories
